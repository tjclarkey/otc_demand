# otc_demand
I estimate a system of demand equations for over the counter pain medication

## What happens in this project
-> Use LA-AIDS
-> Use OLS and IV on the LA-AIDS model at the lower level
-> Estimate the model at the middle and upper level
-> Compare the accuracy of the three lower level models I estimate

### What I want to add to complete the project
-> Calculate the _conditional_ and _unconditional_ elasticities
-> Present results with a dashboard
